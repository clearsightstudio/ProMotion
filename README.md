# ProMotion - A new way to easily build RubyMotion apps.

ProMotion introduces a new object called "Screens". Screens have a one-to-one relationship 
with your app's designed screens.

Check out the tutorial here: http://www.clearsightstudio.com/insights/ruby-motion-promotion-tutorial

Sample app here: https://github.com/jamonholmgren/promotion-tutorial

Typical app file structure:

    app/
      screens/
        photos/
          list_photos_screen.rb
          show_photo_screen.rb
          edit_photo_screen.rb
        home_screen.rb
        settings_screen.rb
      models/
      views/
      app_delegate.rb

## Usage

Loading your home screen:

```ruby
# In /app/app_delegate.rb (note that AppDelegate extends ProMotion::AppDelegateParent)
class AppDelegate < ProMotion::AppDelegateParent
  def on_load(app, options)
    open_screen MyHomeScreen.new(nav_bar: true)
  end
end
```

Creating a basic screen:

```ruby
class HomeScreen < ProMotion::Screen
  title "Home"

  def on_load
    # Set up the elements in your view with add_element:
    @label = add_element UILabel.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(5, 5, 20, 20)), {
      text: "This is awesome!",
      font: UIFont.systemFontOfSize(18)
    }
  end
  
  def on_appear
    # Refresh the data if you want
  end
end
```

Creating a tabbed bar from a screen (this has to be done inside a screen -- it won't work
in your app_delegate.rb). This will set the tab bar as the root view controller for your app,
so keep that in mind. 

NOTE: It needs to be done in the on_appear or afterward, not the `on_load` or
`will_appear`. We will likely fix this in the future, but for now that's a restriction.

```ruby
def on_appear
  @home     ||= MyHomeScreen.new(nav_bar: true)
  @settings ||= SettingsScreen.new
  @contact  ||= ContactScreen.new(nav_bar: true)
  @tab_bar  ||= open_tab_bar @home, @settings, @contact
end
```

For each screen that belongs to the tab bar, you need to set the tab name and icon in the files. 
In this example, we would need add the following to the three files (my_home_screen.rb, settings_screen.rb, contact_screen.rb):

```ruby
def on_opened
  set_tab_bar_item title: "Tab Name Goes Here", icon: "tab_icon.png" # in resources folder
end
```

Any view item (UIView, UIButton, etc) can be used with add_element.
The second argument is a hash of settings that get applied to the
element before it is dropped into the view.

```ruby
@label = add_element UILabel.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(5, 5, 20, 20)), {
  text: "This is awesome!",
  font: UIFont.UIFont.systemFontOfSize(18)
}
```

Add a nav_bar button and a tab_bar icon:

```ruby
set_nav_bar_right_button "Save", action: :save_something, type: UIBarButtonItemStyleDone
set_tab_bar_item title: "Contacts", system_icon: UITabBarSystemItemContacts
```

Open a new screen:

```ruby
def settings_button_tapped
  # ...with a class...
  open_screen SettingsScreen

  # ...or with an instance...
  @settings_screen = SettingsScreen.new
  open_screen @settings_screen
end
```

Open a new screen as a modal:

```ruby
open_screen SettingsScreen, modal: true
```

You can pass in arguments to other screens if they have accessors:

```ruby
class HomeScreen < ProMotion::Screen
  # ...

  def settings_button_tapped
    open_screen ProfileScreen.new(user: some_user)
  end
end

class ProfileScreen < ProMotion::Screen
  attr_accessor :user

  def on_load
    self.user # => some_user instance
  end
end

```

Close a screen (modal or in a nav controller), passing back arguments to the previous screen's "on_return" method:

```ruby
class ItemScreen
  # ...
  def save_and_close
    if @model.save
      close_screen(model_saved: true)
    end
  end
end

class MainScreen < ProMotion::Screen
  # ...
  def on_return(args = {})
    if args[:model_saved]
      self.reload_something
    end
  end
end
```

Use a custom view controller:

```ruby
def on_load
  set_view_controller MyCustomViewController
  
  # Note: on_appear will not fire when using a custom 
  # view controller.
end
```

The helper add_element takes any view object and adds it to the current view. You can also use
the helper ProMotion::ViewHelper.set_attributes(view, attributes) to do the same thing without adding
it to the current view. Screens include this helper by default.

```ruby
@element = add_element UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(0, 0, 20, 20)), {
  backgroundColor: UIColor.whiteColor
}

@element = set_attributes UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(0, 0, 20, 20)), {
  backgroundColor: UIColor.whiteColor
}
```

You can create sectioned table screens easily. TableScreen, SectionedTableScreen, GroupedTableScreen.
This is loosely based on [motion-table](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/motion-table) (there are a 
few minor differences).

```ruby
class SettingsScreen < ProMotion::GroupedTableScreen
  title "Settings"

  def on_load
    add_right_nav_button(label: "Save", action: :save)
    set_tab_bar_item(title: "Settings", icon: "settings.png")
  end
  
  # table_data is automatically called. Use this format in the return value.
  # Grouped tables are the same as plain tables
  def table_data
    [{
      title: "Your Account",
      cells: [
        { title: "Edit Profile", action: :edit_profile, arguments: { id: 3 } },
        { title: "Log Out", action: :log_out },
        { title: "Notification Settings", action: :notification_settings }
      ]
    }, {
      title: "App Stuff",
      cells: [
        { title: "About", action: :show_about },
        { title: "Feedback", action: :show_feedback }
      ]
    }]
  end

  # This method allows you to create a "jumplist", the index on the right side of the table
  def table_data_index
    return ["A", "B", "C"]
  end
  
  # Your table cells, when tapped, will execute the corresponding actions and pass in arguments:
  def edit_profile(arguments)
    # ...
  end
end
```

### What about MVC?

I'm a big believer in MVC (I'm a Rails developer, too). I found that most of the time working in RubyMotion seems to happen
in the ViewControllers and views are mainly custom elements. This pattern is probably best for navigation controller and
tab bar based apps.
