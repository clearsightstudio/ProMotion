## iPhone Apps, Ruby-style

ProMotion is a RubyMotion gem that makes iOS development more like Ruby and less like Objective-C.
It introduces a clean, Ruby-style syntax for building screens that is easy to learn and remember and
abstracts a ton of boilerplate UIViewController, UINavigationController, and other iOS code into a
simple, Ruby-like DSL.

Watch the [September Motion Meetup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf7h-3AiMRQ) where Gant Laborde
interviews Jamon Holmgren about ProMotion!

```ruby
# app/app_delegate.rb
class AppDelegate < PM::Delegate
  def on_load(app, options)
    open RootScreen.new(nav_bar: true)
  end
end

# app/screens/root_screen.rb
class RootScreen < PM::Screen
  title "Root Screen"

  def on_load
    set_bar_button :right, title: "Help", action: :push_help_screen
  end

  def push_help_screen
    open HelpScreen
  end
end

# app/screens/help_screen.rb
class HelpScreen < PM::TableScreen
  title "Table Screen"

  def table_data
    [{
      title: "Help",
      cells: [
        { title: "About this app", action: :tapped_about },
        { title: "Log out", action: :log_out }
      ]
    }]
  end
end
```

# Getting Started

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/Guide:-Getting-Started) in the wiki!

# What's New?

## Version 1.1.x

* Added a [ProMotion executable](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/Command-Line-Tool) called `promotion`. You can type `promotion new <myapp>` and it will create a ProMotion-specific app. We will be adding more functionality in the future.
* Can now pass a symbol to `add`, `add_to`, and `set_attributes` to call a method with that name to get styles.
* Added `button_title:` to `open_split_screen` to [customize the auto-generated button title](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::SplitScreen#open_split_screenmaster-detail-args--)
* Updates to [set_tab_bar_button](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::Tabs#set_tab_bar_itemargs)
* Added to PM::Delegate [`on_open_url(args = {})`](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::Delegate#on_open_urlargs--) where `args` contains `:url`, `:source_app`, and `:annotation`
* Added to PM::Delegate [`tint_color`](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::Delegate#tint_color) to customize the application-wide tint color
* Added to [PM::MapScreen annotations](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion/wiki/API-Reference:-ProMotion::MapScreen) the ability to set an image
* Removed legacy `navigation_controller` references which were causing confusion.
* Allowed setting a `custom_view` for `bar_button_item`s.
* Added `will_begin_search` and `will_end_search` callbacks to PM::TableScreen.
* Added `title_view` and `title_view_height` to sections in PM::TableScreen.
* Updated screenshots for iOS 7
* Refactored code and lots of new passing tests
